# DOMminiprojects 
In those mini projects I implement some logic to build different applications in which I dealed with the DOM using JavaScript programming language . 
Those applications consist of a calculator , cloning a div with various colors, manipulating a text by controlling its size, its font family, etc and the last project was about cloning an image and adjusting a list .
